# Hand Gesture & Face Recognition System (OpenCV, Python, ML)

Built a computer vision system using OpenCV and Python that detects **hand gestures for form filling** and captures photos of **unknown individuals**.  
For known users, it performs **liveness detection** by tracking **blinks and head movements**.  
The system stores data of unknown people along with gesture inputs, ensuring both **identification** and **security**.
